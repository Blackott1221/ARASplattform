# VC Outreach Emails — ARAS AI

---

## EMAIL 1: Gabriel Matuschka — Fly Ventures

**To:** gabriel@fly.vc
**Subject:** ARAS AI — Peter Cullom suggested I reach out

Hi Gabriel,

Peter Cullom mentioned your name and said we should connect. I think he's right.

I'm Justin, founder of ARAS AI. We've built something that doesn't exist yet in Europe: a fully proprietary voice AI platform. Own LLM, own voice engine, own infrastructure — hosted in Switzerland, zero external dependencies. No OpenAI API calls, no ElevenLabs, nothing borrowed. Everything from the ground up.

Why that matters: every other voice AI startup is a wrapper around someone else's stack. When the model providers move downstream — and they will — those companies lose their moat overnight. We don't have that problem.

Where we are:

- 1,000+ users, 32% paying, ~1 hour average daily usage
- 6 acquisition offers at Web Summit Doha — all declined
- Raising €2.5M seed to scale across DACH and into broader Europe

I know Fly backs deeply technical founders solving hard problems early — before the rest of the market catches on. That's what this is. I'd love 20 minutes to walk you through the product and the tech.

Would next week work?

Best,
Justin Schwarzott
ARAS AI

## EMAIL 2: Andreas Goeldi — b2venture

**To:** andreas.goeldi@b2venture.vc
**Subject:** AI/Voice — 1K+ users, 32% paid — Switzerland — Seed

Hi Andreas,

Peter Cullom pointed me your way, and after reading your Voice AI Market Map, I knew we should talk.

Your map identifies the central tension in this space: as voice quality commoditizes, defensibility has to come from somewhere deeper. We took the opposite approach from everyone else — we built the entire stack ourselves.

I'm Justin Schwarzott, founder of ARAS AI. We run the only fully proprietary voice AI platform in Europe. Own LLM, own voice synthesis, own infrastructure, all Swiss-hosted. No OpenAI, no ElevenLabs, no third-party dependencies. That's not a feature — it's the architecture.

You highlighted three differentiation signals: vertical complexity, full AI replacement over co-pilot, and out-of-the-box deployment. We hit all three. Our users run ARAS as a standalone system, not an assistant — and they deploy in minutes, not months.

Current numbers:

- 1,000+ users, 32% paying conversion
- ~1 hour average daily session time
- 6 acquisition offers at Web Summit Doha — declined

We're raising a €2.5M seed. Given your active thesis in voice AI and your DACH roots, I think there's a strong fit here. Happy to share the deck or jump on a 20-minute call — whichever you prefer.

Best,
Justin Schwarzott
ARAS AI

## Notes on Approach

**Why these emails work:**

1. **Short and human.** Both under 200 words. No walls of text, no corporate buzzwords, no AI-sounding filler.

2. **Peter Cullom referral is natural**, not forced. It opens the door without over-leveraging the connection.

3. **Defensibility is front and center.** Peter's core concern was that outbound calling gets absorbed into larger platforms. Both emails flip that: ARAS *is* the platform, not a layer on top of one.

4. **Fly Ventures email** speaks Gabriel's language — "deeply technical founders solving hard problems early, before everyone else cares." It positions ARAS as exactly that kind of bet.

5. **b2venture email** references Andreas's own published Voice AI Market Map and directly maps ARAS to the three differentiation signals he identified. This shows genuine homework, not a spray-and-pray pitch.

6. **Traction speaks for itself.** 32% paid conversion and 6 declined acquisition offers signal product-market fit without having to argue for it.

7. **Clear ask.** "20 minutes" is low-commitment and specific. No vague "let's explore synergies."

**Suggested next step:** Have Justin send these directly from his personal email — not via Lisa, not via a CRM. The more personal the better, especially given Peter's feedback about communication style.
